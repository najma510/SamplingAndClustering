It contains report in excel sheet about Sampling and Clustering of Plant Phenotypic Data
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the following folders:-

1.Clustering 
2.Sampling
3.Data
4.Distance Matrices
5.Other Helper FUnctions

1. Clustering contains scripts and results of clustering the data using Spectral Clustering, UPGMA Clustering and K-means Clustering Techniques. 

2. Sampling contains the scripts and results of Sampling using Pivotal sampling and Vector Quantization techniques.

For each of the above-mentioned techniques, there will be mainly 3 subfolders:-
	a.Reports: It contains report in excel sheet about how the technique performed on varying various parameters.

	b.Scripts: It contains all the scripts and functions used.

	c.Data: It contains the data on which the algorithm was run.

3.Data: It contains the Normalized, categorized and uncategorized data with reduced attributes which were used throughout the project. It also contains the original excel data.

4.Distance Matrices: It contains scripts to get the distance/similarity matrices from the normalized data using the following methods-Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine and Jaccard.

5.Others: It contains some other helper functions which were used.

##.All the scripts were written in MatLab R2015a and hence are in .m format. Any text editor can be used to view and edit it.

##.All the data used is provided in .dat format which can be directly loaded in MatLab.

##.All the reports are in .xlsx format. To view them one can use any spreadsheet viewing software, preferably Microsoft Excel.
